# Disclaimer and License

The RPG ROS DVS package has been tested under ROS Indigo (Ubuntu 14.04) and ROS Kinetic (Ubuntu 16.04).

This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

# Package Overview

The ROS DVS package provides C++ drivers for the [Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS)](https://inilabs.com/products/dynamic-vision-sensors/) and the [Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS)](https://inilabs.com/products/dynamic-and-active-pixel-vision-sensor/).
Even if you do not have a DAVS or DAVIS device, you can still [use this driver to read pre-recorded event data files (see the example below)](#ExampleEventCameraDataset).
The package also provides a calibration tool for both intrinsic and stereo calibration.
To find out more about event cameras, visit the website of the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](http://siliconretina.ini.uzh.ch/wiki/index.php).
The package is based on [libcaer](https://github.com/inilabs/libcaer).

# Driver Installation

1. Make sure, libusb is installed on your system:  
   `$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

2. Install ROS dependencies:  
   `$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-camera-info-manager`  
   `$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-view`  

3. Install catkin tools:  
   `$ sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools`

4. Create a catkin workspace (if you have not done it yet):  
   `$ cd`  
   `$ mkdir -p catkin_ws/src`  
   `$ cd catkin_ws`  
   `$ catkin config --init --mkdirs --extend /opt/ros/kinetic --merge-devel --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`  

5. Clone the `catkin_simple` package (https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple), which will be used to build the DVS/DAVIS driver packages:  
   `$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src`  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple.git`  

6. Clone this repository:  
   `$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src`  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros.git`  

7. Build the packages:  
    * `$ catkin build dvs_ros_driver`  (if you are using the DVS)  
    * `$ catkin build davis_ros_driver`  (if you are using the DAVIS)  

8. Only a udev rule is needed to run the DVS driver. An installation script is provided in the package `libcaer_catkin`.  
  `$ roscd libcaer_catkin`  (need to source your setup.bash file first, or just do `$ cd libcaer_catkin`)  
  `$ sudo ./install.sh`

9. You can test the installation by running a provided launch file. It starts the driver (DVS or DAVIS) and the renderer (an image viewer).  
    1. First, build the renderer:  
        `$ catkin build dvs_renderer`  
        `$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`  
    2. Then, launch the example:  
        * `$ roslaunch dvs_renderer dvs_mono.launch`  (if you are using the DVS)
        * `$ roslaunch dvs_renderer davis_mono.launch` (if you are using the DAVIS)  
    You should get an image like this (in case of the DAVIS):

        ![dvs_rendering_screenshot_19 04 2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8024432/25172262/b96baaa0-24f0-11e7-9c3e-e33f6d398a4a.png)

10. **If you do not have a DAVIS, you can still use this driver to read recorded files**, such as those of [The Event Camera Dataset and Simulator](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/davis_data.html). **Example**: <a name="ExampleEventCameraDataset"></a>
    1. Download a squence of the dataset, such as [slider_depth.bag](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/datasets/davis/slider_depth.bag)  
    2. Open a terminal and launch the roscore:  
    `$ roscore`  
    3. In another terminal, play the bag:  
    `$ rosbag play -l path-to-file/slider_depth.bag`  
    4. In another terminal, launch the DVS/DAVIS renderer:  
    `$ roslaunch dvs_renderer renderer_mono.launch`  
    You should see a movie with images like this:  

        ![slider_depth_renderer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8024432/25312371/9afd4180-2817-11e7-9e33-cdaa8af1e6ed.png)

11. Optional: in the case of a **live stream** from the DAVIS (i.e., not a recorded file) you may adjust the DVS/DAVIS parameters to your needs using the dynamic reconfigure GUI. Run  
   `$ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure`  
   and a window will appear. Select the `davis_ros_driver` (on the left panel) and you should get the following GUI that allows you to modify the parameters of the sensor.

   ![davis_ros_driver_rqt_reconfigure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8024432/25172274/c1267b8a-24f0-11e7-8130-af551a8a958d.png)

   A guide on how to modify the parameters in the bottom half of the GUI (biases) can be found here: https://inilabs.com/support/hardware/biasing/


# Calibration
For intrinsic or stereo calibration of the DVS and DAVIS, please have a look at the following [document](dvs_calibration/README.md).


# Troubleshooting
## New dvs_msgs format
If you recorded rosbags with a previous version of this package, they must be migrated.
The format for the timestamps changed from uint64 to rostime.
To convert an "old" bag file, use   
`$ rosbag fix old.bag new.bag`.

## Compiling error
On Ubuntu 14.04 with GCC 4.8, you will receive an error about missing file (`stdatomic.h`).
This is a [problem](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58016) related to GCC 4.8 and can be resolved by [updating to version 4.9](http://askubuntu.com/a/581497/218846):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9
